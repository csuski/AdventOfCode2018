# Advent Of Code 2018
https://adventofcode.com

Primary goal is to use this to learn Go. 

Write solutions as quickly as possibly in Go learning what I need to complete the problem during the event.

I hope to go by the end to be able to go back with what I have learned (and time) to improve the code.

I would like to also implement them in other languages so I can compare the soltions.

I may switch to implementing the solutions in C# if they are taking more time than I have.
